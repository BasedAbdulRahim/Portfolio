          <h3>üí¨ Tell me about yourself</h3>
          <p>Hi, my name is Based Abdul Rahim, and I‚Äôm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering at the University of Ottawa. I‚Äôve completed core coursework in areas like data structures, operating systems, digital systems, and software design, which has given me a strong foundation in both theoretical computer science and practical software engineering.

            I enjoy building and optimizing real-world applications‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a Java-based AI maze pathfinder or a responsive web platform built for a university health initiative. Through these projects, I‚Äôve developed a passion for writing clean, maintainable code and applying design principles that enhance user experience.
            
            Outside of academics, I‚Äôve worked in fast-paced environments like Walmart, where I strengthened my organizational and teamwork skills. I also initiated the Dale Brown Technology Award to recognize perseverance and commitment in tech‚Äîsomething I value deeply.
            
            Right now, I‚Äôm looking to grow further by contributing to meaningful software projects and learning from experienced engineers. I‚Äôm especially excited about opportunities that combine problem-solving, product design, and team collaboration.</p>

          <h3>‚ùó What is a weakness of yours?</h3>
          <p>I'm very detail-oriented, which sometimes slows my progress. I'm working on improving my time management and balancing precision with speed.</p>
